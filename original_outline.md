    Introduction
        Brief personal introduction
        Background information on data science
            Definition and practical uses
            Python’s important place in the landscape
        Today’s practical application: Figuring out where Python programmers most often have trouble and how we can think 2 steps ahead by proactively learning about it.
        Problem space: Stack Overflow has this data. How do we extract it and most quickly make sense of it?
    Extract data
        Problem: What do you do when the public API is not enough?
        Background: Data scraping
        Draw diagram of data flow
        Use requests to get data
            Background: How to actually shuffle data around on a computer using standard library
                Files and reusable Python scripts
                Python packages: sys and os
        Use Beautiful Soup to structure data
            Background:
                structured vs unstructured data
                Linus Torvalds - "Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships."
    Cleaning Data
        Problem: Structured, but still as (or more) difficult to systematically analyze.
        Background:
            Noisy data
            Natural Language Processing
        Solution: Clean data using custom code and Pandas
            Data frames
            Successively cleaning
                Background: Emphasis on the human element of this. Brief explanation of how this landscape is rapidly evolving.
    Cleaning Data evolves into a visualization-cleaning cycle.
        We stop when we are satisfied.
    Identification of the top concepts
        Rapid explanation thereof and encourage to RTFM.
